# Younhong's Personal Website
Website oiriginally designed for the asssignment of Hybrid Web Course, but I have expanded the function and the design of the website using the techniques I learned from Web Service Development.

# Techniques used
* Basic skills on using HTML, CSS, PHP, mySQL and Javascript
* Semantic Tags
* JQuery
* NodeJS
* Bootstrap
* WordPress, Wix.com
* OpenAPI (omdbapi, Handong Service menu)
* Docker (for setting WordPress)

# Server
* AWS(Amazon Web service), XAMPP Apache Server

# Structure of Web Page
> Web Page is desgined with using Semantic tags such as header, main and footer.

# Before Executing Program, Please Read this part. Very Important!!
> If you move on to main page, you will see link with the line "Wild Life". This link will lead you to page that is different from others. This page is executed with apache server with localhost port 81. So if you need to test the code there, please install XAMPP and set the apache server port number to 81. Then, find a htdocs folders in XAMPP directory. If you found it, put Web directory which I have posted inside it. Then, you will need to execute the code createDB.php, createTable.php, createTable2.php before you execute the program, since what you entered in page will store the data made with the php files mentioned above.
